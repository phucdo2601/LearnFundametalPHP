Difference Between include and require Statements
You might be thinking if we can include files using the include() statement then why we need require(). 
Typically the require() statement operates like include().

to continue if the file to be included can't be found, whereas the require() statement will generate a fatal error and stops the script execution.

The include_once and require_once Statements
If you accidentally include the same file (typically functions or classes files) more than one time within your code using the include or require statements, 
it may cause conflicts. To prevent this situation, PHP provides include_once and require_once statements. These statements behave in the same way as 
include and require statements with one exception.

The include_once and require_once statements will only include the file once even if asked to include it a second time i.e. if the specified file 
has already been included in a previous statement, the file is not included again. To better understand how it works, let's check out an example. 
Suppose we've a 'my_functions.php' file with the following code:
